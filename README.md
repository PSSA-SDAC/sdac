# UTSC PSSA - Social Data Analysis Committee 
## Objectives:
The Social Data Analysis Committee (SDAC) aims to introduce undergraduate political science students to data science skills to enhance their research capabilities and professional careers. Through workshops, projects, and competitions, students will learn to analyze and interpret social data, develop professional GitHub portfolios, and gain insights into political, social, and economic issues.

## Workshop Series:
SDAC workshops are designed to provide hands-on experience in data analysis using R and Python – covering various topics from research methods to machine learning.

## Drop-in Codings Days:
Randomly scheduled, informal environment dedicated to learning to code, playing with data, and collaborating with peers.

## Stats & Coding Helpline:
Accessible via the Committee GitHub Pages (forthcoming). Students can request help with specific problems and be connected with an upper-year student or committee member who can assist them.

## Events:
In-person Data-thons where students compete to solve complex political science problems under time constraints. Prizes will be awarded to the top teams.

## Team:
•	Michael Cowan, Patrick Schnurbusch (HBA Political Science, 2015), Ibrahim Sereer, Eric Wu, Arun Kamalakanthan, Taiba Ahmed
