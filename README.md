# UTSC PSSA - Social Data Analysis Committee 
The Social Data Analysis Committee (SDAC) aims to introduce undergraduate political science students to data science skills to enhance their research capabilities and professional careers. 

Through workshops, projects, and competitions, students will learn to analyze and interpret social data, develop professional GitHub portfolios, and gain insights into political, social, and economic issues.

## Workshop Series
SDAC workshops are designed to provide hands-on experience in data analysis using R and Python – covering various topics from research methods to machine learning.

## Drop-in Coding Days
Randomly scheduled, informal environment dedicated to learning to code, playing with data, and collaborating with peers. Events will appear on https://www.instagram.com/pssa.utsc/.

## Stats & Coding Helpline
Request help with specific problems and be connected with an upper-year student or committee member who can assist! Email sdac.pssa@gmail.com to request a timeslot!

## Events
Semesterly in-person Data-thon(s) where students compete to solve complex political science problems under time constraints (dates forthcoming). Prizes will be awarded to the top teams.
